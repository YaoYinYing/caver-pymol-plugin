# Playback processed results

Use the playback tab to reopen tunnels generated in earlier runs without recalculating anything.

## 1. Point to the output directory

The plugin discovers available runs by scanning the directory you choose here. Set it to the same location you specified during the calculation step.

## 2. Load or refresh a structure (optional)

Having the original structure loaded makes it easier to inspect tunnels, but playback itself does not depend on the current input model.

## 3. Enable playback

1. Check **Results playback**.
2. Click **Refresh** to list all run IDs stored in the output directory.
3. Select the run that matches your structure/trajectory.
4. Click **Load** to load historic run result.

Static runs load tunnel surfaces as spheres; dynamic runs import lines along the trajectory states.
