# Caver result playback

## Output directory

Output directory is essential to any part of Caver analysis.

## Load structure

Load a normal structure model into PyMOL session and launch Caver Plugin. Ensure the correct model is selected in `Input Model`


## Enable playback and discover run ids

1. Enable `results playback` and click `Refresh` to discover results that already processed. It does not matter whether the input model is correct or not. Tunnel Analyst and Previewer will not use it.
2. Pick the correct run id that **matches** the model and trajectory.
3. Click `Load` to open Analyst window.

For static result, tunnel will be shown as spheres. For dynamics, they will be loaded as lines.
