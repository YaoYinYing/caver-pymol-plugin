This directory, with its subdirs, should contain detail instructions and tutorials on running Caver w/ PyMOL and the analysing process.

Currently it has basic operation steps recorded. Tutorial tree:

- setup: docs/0-install/1-setup.md
- static analysis: docs/1-caver/1-static.md
- dynamic analysis: docs/1-caver/2-dynamic.md
- result playback: docs/1-caver/3-playback.md
- caver analyst: docs/2-analyst/1-preview.md
- caver tunnel plot: docs/2-analyst/2-plot.md
- tunnel movie tutorial: docs/3-tunnel_movie/1-get_started.md

Get them informative and structured. Fix language errors and expressions like a native English speaker.
