This is CAVER 3.02. Please check http://www.caver.cz/ for the latest release.


Version 3.02
------------
- More efficient version of UPGMA clustering algorithm is available and used
as default. Previous version can still be used by setting 'clustering_algorithm'
to 'loewenstein' (default is the efficient algorithm - 'murtagh'). Disc space
is no longer needed to store distance matrix. Clustering speed benefits from
large RAM (and accordingly set java -Xmx values).


Version 3.01
------------
- The starting point optimization procedure was corrected. Previously, the
starting vertex was sometimes identified in too narrow cavity due to error
in implementation. The change can lead to minor changes in the geometric
properties of tunnels, similarly as if the parameter seed is modified.
Return to the previous behavior is possible by setting 'correct_voronoi_diagram'
to 'no' (this is not recommended).

- Previously, three letters were expected for residue name when reading PDB
files (columns 18 - 20). This complies to the PBB file Format Guide, however,
some structures use four letters (columns 18 - 21). CAVER now reads four letters
as default, but it is possible to return to the three letter mode by setting
'long_residue_names' to 'no'.

- The atom serial number can now be composed of letters, not just digits. In such
cases, letters are interpreted as additional digits 10, 11, 12, etc. This is useful
for loading large PDB files.


Version 3.0
-----------
- The parameter add_central_sphere was added and activated. This removes
cospherical positions of centers of balls representing one atom, which sometimes
caused placement of starting point in the center of an atom. The change can lead
to minor changes in the geometric properties of tunnels, similarly as if the
parameter seed is modified. It is recommended not to change the default value.

- Default value of the parameter average_surface_point_min_angle was changed
 from 5.73 to 5. This can lead to minor changes in results of clustering.
